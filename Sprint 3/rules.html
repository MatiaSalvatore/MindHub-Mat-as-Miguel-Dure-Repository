        The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
        youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player,
        coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior
        detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless
        of technical hockey background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.
